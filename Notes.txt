- README contains very clear and complete instructions
- the code is well commented and organized

- no test with complex variables

- no speedup with compression

- operator* for A*v when v is a matrix: not very efficient to copy the matrix in a vector when it has a big size.
- the matrix-vector multiplication, at least in the case where v is a matrix of one column, should return a matrix.

- the method norm could have been template with respect to norm choice
