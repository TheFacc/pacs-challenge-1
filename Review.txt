- The README.md file is detailed and accurate. Nice job!

You have only one commit: you dind't really use github.

- Inside the Makefile it was missing the include path for the muParser.
  How were you able to compile the code?


The code is overall well written. The attention to details is remarkable. 

- The addition on the input from terminal is very nice. However, why didn't you use GetPot or JSON?
  GetPot allows you to both handle files and command line input.

- Why are there return 1; commented in all the code? 

- Why you don't have the main separated from the header files? I would have liked to see the optimization functions implemented in a header file. This would have also improved readability.

- I don't like only only file... I would have preferred multiple classes. Would have been more clear

Please don't leave commented lines of codes when delivering
